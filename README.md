## Sample Generated Quotes

```
Instead, the internals should be really excellent. Because this is not well written.  
For me, a comment is almost a note like "I should try to rewrite this code later."  
I think it is also easy to fall out of touch with the Universe to create bigger and  
better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to decide what to do,  
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings who can figure costs,  
and so they are forgiving of certain kinds of errors.

Avoid OO whenever possible. Contrary to common belief, most problems are local and you donâ€™t  
know quite where you are making one.
